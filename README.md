# Pomodoro Clock

### Overview
The Pomodoro Clock is a simple time management tool that helps users break their work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This method is known as the Pomodoro Technique. Your implementation involves a countdown timer that automatically transitions between work and break periods, allowing the user to focus on tasks with timed breaks in between.
